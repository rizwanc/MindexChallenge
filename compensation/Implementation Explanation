For this task I create two new rest endpoints one using POST and the other using GET. 
I created a new Compensation class which have the properties: employee, id, salary, and effective date. 
In this class I also created two constructors. One constructor is used to bind the initial POST json payload, allowing me 
to access the employee id via the getID method and to find the associated employee object. The other constructor allows me 
to create a compensation object which stored the employee, salary, and effective date. After the compensation object is created,
a GET request can be made given the employee ID. The appropriate employee object is then returned along with the salary 
and effective date. In order to make the GET and POST requests, I used the POSTMAN software. In addition to the Compensation class,
I also created the Compensation Controller class which contains the POST and GET function mappings and the 
CompensationService class which contains the save and and get methods. In the compensation service class I include
the Autowired annotation to allow for the dependency injection of the employee repository and the 
compensation repository which I made to allow for the storage of the compensation object. 
Below is an example of the returned information after a get request has been made:

{
    "employee": {
        "employeeId": "16a596ae-edd3-4847-99fe-c4518e82c86f",
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Lennon",
        "position": "Development Manager",
        "department": "Engineering",
        "directReports": [
            {
                "employeeId": "b7839309-3348-463b-a7e3-5de1c168beb3",
                "firstName": null,
                "lastName": null,
                "position": null,
                "department": null,
                "directReports": null
            },
            {
                "employeeId": "03aa1462-ffa9-4978-901b-7c001562cf6f",
                "firstName": null,
                "lastName": null,
                "position": null,
                "department": null,
                "directReports": null
            }
        ]
    },
    "id": "16a596ae-edd3-4847-99fe-c4518e82c86f",
    "salary": 32400,
    "effectiveDate": "05/31/2018"
}
